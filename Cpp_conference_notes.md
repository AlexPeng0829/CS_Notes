| Tuning C++ benmarks, and CPUs and Compilers                     | Chandler Carruth           | Benchmarking               | Intro to micro-benchmarking using google-benchmark and perf tool. A simple example of `push_back` in `std::vector` was used to demonstrate how compiler would optimize the code into the direction where we possibly wouldn't expect. Some clever techniques(via raw assembly code) could be used as signs to compilers so that the code would be optimized in the way we don't want and therefore yielding the accurate benchmark result. | :star::star::star::star: |
