# CS_Notes

This is a set of personal record and reflection for me when learning different topics in computer science.

Work in progress:
- Notes on watching cpp conference 2014~2020 and cpp and beyond 2012.

Some possible topics which would be updated later are:

- Study on memory model.

- Modern C++ learning note.

- Booting process for OS(RISC/CISC).
